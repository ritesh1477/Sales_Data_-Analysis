This analysis shows the overall report of a company sales from the year 2017-2020
It shows the revenue generated by different states, top 5 customer by revenue, top products by revenue, sales quantity by market.
For making the reports and to find the actual numbers, I used SQL to get to the exact number and remove all the dirty data from the dataset.
Added a revenue trend chart against the year to get the clear picture of the sales
